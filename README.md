# Simple PHP Router
Hey! This is a simple and small single class PHP router that can handle the whole URL routing for your project.
It utilizes RegExp and PHP's anonymous functions to create a lightweight and fast routing system.
The router supports dynamic path parameters, special 404 and 405 routes as well as verification of request methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
The codebase is very small and very easy to understand. So you can use it as a boilerplate for a more complex router.

Take a look at the index.php file. As you can see the `Route::add()` method is used to add new routes to your project.
The first argument takes the path segment. You can also use RegExp in there to parse out variables.
All matching variables will be pushed to the handler method defined in the second argument.
The third argument will match the request method. The default method is 'get'.

## üìã Simple example:
```php
// Require the class
include 'src\photographics\Route.php';

// Use this namespace
use photographics\Route;

// Add the first route
Route::add('/user/([0-9]*)/edit', function($id) {
  echo 'Edit user with id '.$id.'<br>';
}, 'get');

// Run the router
Route::run('/');
```

You will find a more complex example with a build in navigation in the index.php file.

## üé∂ Installation using Composer
Just run `composer require photographics/simple-php-router`
Than add the autoloader to your project like this:
```php
// Autoload files using composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Use this namespace
use photographics\Route;

// Add your first route
Route::add('/', function() {
  echo 'Welcome :-)';
});

// Run the router
Route::run('/');
```

## ‚õ∫ Use a different basepath
If your script lives in a subfolder (e.g. /api/v1) set this basepath in your run method:

```php
Route::run('/api/v1');
```

Do not forget to edit the basepath in .htaccess too if you are on Apache2.

## ‚èé Use return instead of echo
You don't have to use `echo` to output your content. You can also use the `return` statement. Everything that gets returned is echoed automatically.

```php
// Add your first route
Route::add('/', function() {
  return 'Welcome :-)';
});
```

## ‚áí Use arrow functions
Since PHP 7.4 you can also use arrow functions to output your content. So you can easily use variables from outside and you can write shorter code.
Please be aware that an Arrow function must always return a value. Therefore you cannot use `echo` directly in here.
You can find an example in index.php. However, this is deactivated, as it only works from PHP 7.4.

```php
Route::add('/arrow/([a-z-0-9-]*)', fn($foo) => 'This is a working arrow function example. Parameter: '.$foo );
```

## üìñ Return all known routes
This is useful, for example, to automatically generate test routes or help pages.

```php
$routes = Route::getAll();
foreach($routes as $route) {
  echo $route['expression'].' ('.$route['method'].')';
}
```

On top of that you could use a library like https://github.com/hoaproject/Regex to generate working example links for the different expressions.

## üß∞ Enable case sensitive routes, trailing slashes and multi match mode
The second, third and fourth parameters of `Route::run('/', false, false, false);` are set to false by default.
Using this parameters you can switch on and off several options:
* Second parameter: You can enable case sensitive mode by setting the second parameter to true.
* Third parameter: By default the router will ignore trailing slashes. Set this parameter to true to avoid this.
* Fourth parameter: By default the router will only execute the first matching route. Set this parameter to true to enable multi match mode.

## ‚Åâ Something does not work?
* Don't forget to set the correct basepath as the first argument in your `run()` method and in your .htaccess file.
* Enable mod_rewrite in your Apache2 settings, in case you're using Apache2: `a2enmod apache2`
* Does Apache2 even load the .htaccess file? Check whether the `AllowOverride All` option is set in the Apache2 configuration like in this example:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName mysite.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/mysite.com
    <Directory "/var/www/html/mysite.com">
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
